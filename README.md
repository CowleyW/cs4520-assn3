Complete submission for Assignment 3.

### Running

If you have Android Studio configured with an appropriate emulator, you should be able to run the application directly after cloning the repository.

Since the assignment uses Android SDK version 31 I have only tested that it works correctly with a corresponding emulator. (Namely Medium Phone API 31) It should work with other versions. 
It DOES NOT work with the Pixel 5 or Pixel 6 emulator ON MY laptop, but I believe that is due to an incompatibility with the GPU emulation. However I cannot confirm, as I only have one laptop so beware ;)
